   - Handles raw log ingestion and ground-truth label extraction
   - Compacts data into efficient two-column format (log, labels)
   - Supports multiple log categories (VPN, web access, DNS, etc.)

2. **Embedding Generation** (`src/*_embedding.py`)
   - **FastText**: 300-dimensional vectors with subword information
   - **Word2Vec**: Efficient word-level representations
   - **LogBERT**: Enhanced 2314-dimensional vectors with attention features

3. **Transformer Model** (`src/transformer.py`)
   - Multi-head attention mechanism for pattern recognition
   - One-vs-rest classification strategy
   - Self-supervised reconstruction loss
   - Teacher-student network integration

4. **Evaluation Framework** (`src/evaluate_models.py`)
   - Multi-metric assessment (F1, precision, recall, accuracy)
   - Threshold optimization for each attack type
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Comparative analysis across embedding methods

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Enhanced LogBERT Embeddings
- Combines CLS token, mean pooling, max pooling, and attention features
- Produces 2314-dimensional rich representations
- Captures both local and global contextual information

#### 2. One-vs-Rest Unsupervised Strategy
- Trains separate binary classifiers for each attack type
- Uses only normal logs for training, making it truly unsupervised
- Achieves high precision by learning normal behavior boundaries

#### 3. Teacher-Student Label Enhancement

- Student network learns from both true and pseudo-labels
- Iterative refinement improves detection accuracy

#### 4. Adaptive Class Balancing
- SMOTE oversampling for minority attack classes
- Dynamic threshold optimization per attack type
- Maintains precision while improving recall for rare events
