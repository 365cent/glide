# Methodology and Findings

This document details the methodology employed in developing the unsupervised transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline and summarizes the key findings from its evaluation.

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Log Compaction

Raw experimental logs, inspired by frameworks like Kyoushi, were used as the primary data source. A crucial step involved extracting ground-truth-labeled events across diverse log categories. These logs were then compacted into a fast-access, minimal-footprint two-column format. This format ensures efficient storage and retrieval, which is vital for handling large volumes of log data.

## 2. Embedding Strategies

To enable direct comparative analysis, the compacted logs were embedded using multiple representation strategies. The following embedding methods were benchmarked:

*   **FastText:** A popular word embedding method that considers subword information, making it effective for out-of-vocabulary words.
*   **Word2Vec:** A neural network-based technique for learning word associations from a large corpus of text.
*   **LogBERT:** A specialized BERT-based model fine-tuned for log data, capturing contextual relationships within log sequences.
*   **LogBERT with Enhanced Features:** An extension of LogBERT incorporating additional features to further improve its representational power.

## 3. Unified Multi-Label Transformer Classifier

The core of the anomaly detection pipeline is a unified multi-label transformer classifier. This classifier was trained using a novel approach combining several advanced techniques:

*   **One-vs-Rest Strategy per Log Type:** For each log type, a separate classifier was trained exclusively on normal (non-anomalous) logs. This approach helps in defining the boundaries of 


normal behavior for each log category.
*   **Self-Supervised Teacher-Student Networks for Label Enhancement:** To address the challenge of limited labeled anomalous data, a self-supervised teacher-student network architecture was employed. The teacher network generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are then used to train the student network. This process iteratively refines the pseudo-labels and improves the model's ability to identify anomalies.
*   **SMOTE for Minority Label Balancing:** Anomaly detection often suffers from class imbalance, where anomalous events are significantly rarer than normal events. To mitigate this, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance minority labels, thereby improving the F1 scores and overall performance on rare anomalies.

## 4. Evaluation and Benchmarking

The final system was rigorously benchmarked across several dimensions to assess its effectiveness:

*   **Embedding Methods Comparison:** Direct comparative analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of FastText, Word2Vec, LogBERT, and LogBERT with enhanced features in the context of anomaly detection.
*   **Multi-Label Classification Quality:** Standard multi-label classification metrics, including micro F1, macro F1, Hamming loss, and Jaccard score, were used to quantify the classifier's performance.
*   **Pseudo-Label Efficacy:** The quality and effectiveness of the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher-student network were validated against the original ground truth labels.
*   **Rare-Event Performance:** Special attention was given to the model's ability to detect rare anomalous events, with specific metrics and analysis dedicated to this challenging aspect.

- **LogBERT Embeddings**: Produce enhanced 2314-dimensional vectors combining CLS tokens, mean pooling, max pooling, and attention features for richer contextual representation.
- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Provide efficient word-level representations suitable for large-scale log processing.

### 5.3 Model Performance and Scalability

The transformer-based approach demonstrates several advantages:

- **Unsupervised Learning**: The one-vs-rest strategy allows training on normal logs only, making the approach suitable for environments with limited labeled anomaly data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The modular design supports processing of large log volumes through efficient data formats and optimized training procedures.
- **Reproducible Results**: All experiments are fully reproducible with versioned scripts and standardized evaluation metrics.

- **Automated Reporting**: Generation of sortable evaluation matrices and detailed classification reports.

### 5.5 Practical Considerations

Several practical insights emerged from the implementation:

- **Data Quality Impact**: The quality and representativeness of training data significantly affects model performance.
- **Embedding Dimensionality**: Higher-dimensional embeddings (LogBERT) may capture more nuanced patterns but require more computational resources.
- **Training Data Requirements**: Sufficient normal log samples are crucial for effective unsupervised learning.

### 5.6 Future Enhancements

The pipeline provides a solid foundation for future improvements:

- **Advanced Teacher-Student Networks**: Implementation of more sophisticated self-supervised learning techniques.
- **Dynamic Threshold Optimization**: Automated threshold tuning for improved precision-recall balance.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Extension to support streaming log analysis for real-time anomaly detection.
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Integration of additional log features beyond text content.

This implementation demonstrates the viability of transformer-based unsupervised anomaly detection for log analysis and provides a robust framework for further research and development in this domain.
